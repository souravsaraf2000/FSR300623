            Marine Drive is a 3 kilometre-long Promenade along the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road in Mumbai, India.
            The road and promenade were constructed by Pallonji Mistry. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along
            the coast of a natural bay. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Girgaon Chowpatty and the adjacent road
            along links Nariman Point at southern tip to Babulnath and Malabar Hill at northern tip. Marine Drive is
            situated on reclaimed land facing west-south-west. Marine Drive is also known as the Queen's Necklace
            because, when viewed at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a
            string of pearls in a necklace.


            Marine Drive from Malabar Hills
            The official name for this road, though rarely used, is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road. The promenade is
            lined with palm trees. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Chowpatty Beach. This is a popular beach famed
            for its Bhel Puri (local fast food). Many restaurants also line this stretch of the road. Further down this
            road lies Walkeshwar, a wealthy neighborhood of the city, also home to the Governor of Maharashtra.

            Most of the buildings erected by wealthy Parsis were constructed in an art deco style, which was popular in
            the 1920s and 1930s. Among the earliest art deco buildings on Marine Drive were the Kapur Mahal, Zaver Mahal
            and Keval Mahal, built between 1937 and 1939 for a total cost of 1 million rupees.[1]

            Real estate prices along the Esplanade are high. Many hotels dot the drive, most prominent among them being
            the 5-star Oberoi (formerly the Oberoi Hilton Tower however reverted to the original name as of early 2008),
            The Intercontinental, Hotel Marine Plaza, Sea Green Hotel and a few other smaller hotels. Marine Drive is
            the preferred connecting road between the central business district located at Nariman Point and the rest of
            the city.

            Many Sports Clubs, some of cricket stadium and club grounds are situated along the stretch of Marine Drive,
            including members-only clubs like the Cricket Club of India (CCI), adjoining the Brabourne Stadium, Hindu
            Gymkhana Ground and Garware Club House, adjacent to the famous Wankhede Stadium, as well as others like the
            Mumbai Police Gymkhana, Hindu Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana and Islam Gymkhana.

            A well known singer from the 1950s, Suraiya lived in a building on the stretch known as 'Krishna Mahal' in
            the ground-floor apartment (as a tenant of Shah family) from 1940s until her death on 31 January 2004. The
            house was first taken on rent by her mother, Mumtaz Begum. Many other film stars, such as Nargis and Raj
            Kapoor, lived nearby in the 1940s and 50s.

            In 2012, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai announced that the entire road would be resurfaced, 72
            years after it was originally laid.[2] A number of bollards were also installed as there was nothing to
            prevent accidents or attacks. A few years earlier, the footpaths were renovated.

            The Marine Drive development commenced in 1915 at Girgaum Chowpatty, also known as Kennedy Sea Face. Most of
            the construction work was completed by the year the 1930s.

            About Marine Drive
            Marine Drive is a 3-kilometer-long Promenade in South Mumbai. It’s a C-shaped concrete footpath along the
            sea line.

            This Promenade is also known as the Queen’s necklace Road. This is due to the night street lights that
            exhibit necklace designs when seen from an elevated height.
            The Marine Drive is a footpath where people can walk. The footpath is quite broad and comfortable for many
            people to walk at one time.

            One of the most beautiful views is the palm trees, planted parallel to the Promenade, giving it a
            magnificent scenic view.

            There is a low wall that separates the sea from the Promenade. People, especially couples, sit on this wall,
            face the sea, and spend time together. Mumbai Police keep patrolling his area to ensure safety.
